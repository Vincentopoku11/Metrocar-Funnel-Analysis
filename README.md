## Tools And Resources
### PostgresSQL, Tableau
* I chose PostgreSQL as my SQL tool of choice for data extraction and in-depth analysis for the Metrocar funnel analysis, employing its extensive features to investigate and comprehend every stage of the customer journey inside the dataset. Additionally, I harnessed the power of Tableau to create engaging and informative data visualisations. These visualisations played a crucial role in offering a comprehensive perspective on the funnel analysis, highlighting key areas of user interaction and drop-off.
